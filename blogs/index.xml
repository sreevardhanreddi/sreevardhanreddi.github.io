In the world of application deployment, two popular options have emerged: running applications on virtual machines (VMs) and using Docker containers. While both approaches have their merits, performance is a critical factor to consider. In this article, we will compare the performance differences between running an application on a VM and running it in a Docker container.

PostgreSQL Views are quite handy, think of Views as wrapping(abstracting) your complex queries and assigning a name to them.
They are several benifits of using Views, here are few
Views hide the complexity
if you have a query that requires aggregating or joining multiple tables and has complex logic, you can code all that logic into a view and then retreive data from it as if it were a normal table.</description></item><item><title>Concurrency in Python</title><link>https://sreevardhanreddi.github.io/blogs/concurrency-in-python/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Aug 2020 15:06:51 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://sreevardhanreddi.github.io/blogs/concurrency-in-python/</guid><description>
Concurrency is the ability of different parts or units of a program, algorithm, or problem to be executed out-of-order or in a partial order, without affecting the final outcome. This allows for parallel execution of the concurrent units, which can significantly improve the overall speed of the execution.</description></item><item><title>Deploying Django Project</title><link>https://sreevardhanreddi.github.io/blogs/deploying-django-project/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jul 2020 17:33:22 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://sreevardhanreddi.github.io/blogs/deploying-django-project/</guid><description>
